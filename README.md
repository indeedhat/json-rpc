This library provides a light weight net/http complient handler for consuming JSON-RPC 2.0 requests  
It is designed to allow you to add a json rpc endpoint to an existing HTTP server

This library should be fully spec complient as of the 2.0 specification, if you find something that
i have missed please let me know and i will fix it, or submit a PR.
